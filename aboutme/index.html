    <h2>Jayvee Galosmo
    </h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Jayvee Galosmo and I am 24 years old from the Philippines. 
        I am married and we are blessed with a baby boy. <br> I have been a member of the church my whole life and also my wife and I also got the opportunity to serve a mission. 
     
        <br>-
        <br>I have been wanting to pursue this course to be a web developer for a long time and right now I'm happy that I got to learn all this cool stuff on creating wonderful websites. 
    </p>
    <p>At present, I work in a big company night shifts at home so I can be with my family. I wanted to improve my skillsets that is why I enrolled in this program. 
        <br>I like to have the freedom to manage my own time so I want to be a freelancer developing websites. <br>
        I enjoy working in a computer doing complicated stuffs.
        I also love to watch movies, play badminton and I know how to play the piano at church. 
    </p>
    <p>I feel that this will be a great class and I look forward to meeting you all as well so I can learn and also contribute to best of my abilities.
    </p>
